Future radio receiver design ideas (from Ismo, Pete and other folks):

Antenna ➔ (BPF) ➔ GALI-74+ based pre-amp or some other pre-amp ➔ MC1496 (Mixer) ➔ 455 kHz IF ➔ Ceramic filter SMD (HCI) ➔ 'IF amplifier' (20-40 dB gain?) ➔ Pico 2's ADC (3+ MSPS) ➔ Digital down-conversion and processing in digital domain ➔ Expose the processed audio samples over USB (Pico 2 acts as a sound card).

Benefits: This enables reception of SSB and CW signals! The 455 kHz IF with digital processing gives us the best of both analog selectivity (ceramic filter) and digital flexibility.

The Pico 2 (RP2350) with dual Cortex-M33 `overclocked` cores should handle:

- Digital mixing/down-conversion
- FIR/IIR filtering
- Demodulation
- USB audio streaming

Also, we are planning to build a opamp powered IF amplifier using the fast `TI TLV3541` part.

Note: Before trying the `digital superhet` version (above), I will likely be using MC1496 in a DCR design first.

We are hoping that `MC1496` continues to be available!

  This way we can continue using `RP2350` instead of moving to something like `STM32H5` immediately
