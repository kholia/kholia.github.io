My old Luminous Zelio inverter (bought in ~2013) lasted for close to 8 years.

Trusting the Luminous brand, I installed two more Luminous Zelio inverters in year 2024 in two different homes.

Come year 2025 and both these Zelio inverters have conked off and that too in less than a year!

I guess they don't make the Zelio inverters the way they used to :-(

For now, I have shifted to `Microtek Heavy Duty UPS 1750` and `Microtek 1275 12V SW` inverter models.
