I am a bit late to realize that Ubuntu is going downhill and has been for a while.

Here are a couple of things I have noticed about Canonical/Ubuntu:

- Forced paid updates even for `active life` OS versions

- Series of bad decisions (Mir, Unity, Upstart, Snaps) causing pain all around

- Inflicting slow and buggy `snap` applications on their users. Not listening to feedback from users - Firefox Snap is really slow to launch, especially on older computers.

- They lost the `container security` game to Chainguard

- [Often poor quality of security updates](https://github.com/json-c/json-c/issues/103) - A userspace patch causing kernel crashes! Ubuntu's security updates were also responsible for the [$5M outage at Datadog](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/inside-the-datadog-outage) it seems.

- Ubuntu is bloated (try running it on Raspberry Pi Zero 2W) compared to Alpine Linux (as of 2025)

I haven't distro-hopped in more than a decade but I am forced to now. After using `MX Linux - Xfce` for a few weeks, I might try running `Debian Sid`!

I found this ['I'm done with Ubuntu'](https://ounapuu.ee/posts/2025/02/05/done-with-ubuntu/) article quite an interesting read as well.
