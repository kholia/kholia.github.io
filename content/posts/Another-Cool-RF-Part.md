I recently spotted the `Tokmas CI7N170SM` TO-247 part on LCSC. It seems like a pretty neat part for building non-QRP HF amplifiers!

This could be a better part for our [Baby QRO amplifier]({{< relref "Baby-QRO-Switching-Amplifier.md" >}}).

## Datasheet Excerpts

The full datasheet is available [here](/pdfs/CI7N170SM.pdf).

## Comparison

In comparison, here is what a professional RF part (MRF300AN) looks like:

That `272W` maximum power dissipation figure is crazy good but switching characteristics are not that great (fast).
