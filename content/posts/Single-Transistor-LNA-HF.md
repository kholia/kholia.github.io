Note: This HF LNA design is inspired by Charlie Morris ZL2CTM's prior work.

The idea that a single-transistor-preamp with 10 dB gain is more than enough for HF comes from Gajendra Kumar (VU2BGS). As a new "designer" I am often overwhelmed by the different possible design paths - so having guidance from an `elmer` becomes crucial.

It seems even MMBT2222A should work for building a HF LNA!

It doesn't feel right to dissipate ~45mW *continuously* in a SOT-23 package, so we will be shifting to PZT2222A (SOT-223) or PXT2222A (SOT-89).

With onsemi part:

So which transistor model is more accurate? ;)

It is a pleasure to work with `onsemi's` .lib spice models - they are usable right away!

This LNA will be used in the RX path of the `DDX Commercial` series of transceivers soon!

As you can see, NXP's transistor model is pretty decent and mimics reality well!
