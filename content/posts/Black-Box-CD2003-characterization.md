Circuit: DDX-Commercial-7

Antenna: Small jumper cable attached

10m: 36 dB on WSJT-X audio meter, on quiet and also with nearby beacon on !!!

12m: 36 dB on audio meter, on quiet and also with nearby beacon on !!!

15m: 46 dB on audio meter on quiet, 65 dB with nearby beacon on - OK

20m: 44 dB on quiet,  65 dB with beacon on - OK 

40m: 40 dB on quiet, 60 dB with beacon on - OK

Next:

Same jumper antenna -> 20 dB LNA (Zeenko BM) -> 10 dB ATTN -> Same RX circuit as before

10m: 47 dB on audio meter on quiet, 63 dB with beacon on. SnR is much improved (checked on WSJT-X spectrum and FT8 decodes).

20m: 55 dB on quiet - OK, frontend running hot?

40m: 54 dB on quiet - OK, frontend running hot?

Finding 1: 10 dB gain works better than 20 dB gain on 10m. Too much gain can be problematic!

With actual 5m EFHW antenna attached: Audio meter is near 60 dB on 10m - great!

Conclusion: We need to fix the RF gain problem on 12m and 10m bands.

With `Zeenko BM` LNA added:

The "waterfall spectrum" display is pretty clean!

CD2003 works even on 6m when LNA is added (!!!).
