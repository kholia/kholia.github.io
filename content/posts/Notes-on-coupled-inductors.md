The usage of ready-made coupled inductors in RF designs was pioneered by Jim Veatch in his award-winning RF amplifier designs.

For `Baby-QRO` applications, we can use `Wurth 744851330` coupled inductor. For 5W / 10W RF amplifier applications, we can use `Bourns SRF1260A-4R7Y` coupled inductor.

Recently we were able to utilize very cost-effective `YJYCOIN YPRH1207C-4R7M` Chinese coupled inductor with excellent results.

With our current `Digital Amplifier` designs, this Chinese coupled inductor works even at ~75 MHz.
