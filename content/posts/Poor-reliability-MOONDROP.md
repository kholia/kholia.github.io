I had bought two pairs of MOONDROP Aria 2 IEMs after auditioning them at a Headphone Connect event.

After a few months of usage, one of the Aria 2 earphones lost audio in the left earpiece. We got it 'serviced' under warranty from https://www.headphonezone.in.

After a year of almost no usage, the other pair of Aria 2 IEMs lost audio in one of the earpieces too!

I have never seen this poor quality, reliability and longevity before!

Once bitten, twice shy. Twice bitten, shy forever? Well, at least I am not going to buy MOONDROP products anymore.

I have been using `KZ Earphones` without such quality and reliability issues for a long time now. I guess they will be getting more business from me at least.
