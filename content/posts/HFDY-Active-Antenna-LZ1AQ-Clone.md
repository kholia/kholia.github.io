The HFDY Active Loop is working extremely well and that too from an indoor location in `MK68`! Pretty awesome ;)

## Design

I am running the loop at 5V (via a regulated linear power supply) currently where it consumes slightly less than 65mA of current. The recommended voltage is 10V, which I will shift to soon.

## Results

I am using `Airspy HF+ Discovery` SDR for this experiment.

## Future work

It would be very interesting to compare this HFDY Active Loop against the PA0FRI Active Antenna.
