I recently found some FET gate drivers which are quite fast!

- [Wuxi Maxinmicro MX1025D](https://www.lcsc.com/product-detail/GaN-Transistors-GaN-HEMT_Wuxi-Maxinmicro-MX1025D_C5341121.html) - Favorite!

- BD2311NVX-LBE2 from ROHM Semiconductor

- [TI LMG1020](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/lmg1020.pdf)

They are perfect for driving the fast Tokmas GaN FETs that we recently discussed on this site.

Our 'workhorse' gate driver for the recent experiments has been the Onsemi's NCP81074ADR2G in a friendly SOIC-8 package.

And we have shifted to `MX1025D` gate driver in our latest amplifier designs.
