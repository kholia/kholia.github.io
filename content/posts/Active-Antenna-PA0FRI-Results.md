My homebrewed PA0FRI Active Antenna is working well from a very physically constrained location.

The antenna is connected to a RSP1 Clone SDR which is running custom FT8-band-hopping software. I am using a `SOLID 4-Way 5-2400 MHz RF splitter` to connect multiple SDRs to the same active antenna. NB: Plug in 75-ohms dummy loads (terminators) on the unused ports of the RF splitter - MX-282 / MX-280 75-ohms dummy loads work fine.

Time to build: Less than 45 minutes for the PCB. The mechanical aspects (loop construction and boxing) can take a while.

My live reception results from this antenna can be viewed at the following URL(s):

Testing Update: A 10m EFHW antenna installed in the same 'surrounded balcony' location receives less than half-the-countries as compared to the PA0FRI active antenna.

Magic might not exist for grownups but the reception results of this Active Antenna from a very limited physical location are nothing short of magical!

Special shout-out goes to Ismo (OH2FTG) and Gajendra Kumar Sir for their guidance on these topics - thank you!

Notes:

The first two decodes in the following screenshot are from a "turned off" active antenna. The last two decodes are from the same active antenna when turned on.

Remember the `Don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good` saying? While theoretically better active-antenna designs exist, we are not keen in pursuing those designs because the results of this PA0FRI AA are good enough (TM).

Update (14-August-2025): My Active Antenna was performing pretty well for weeks and then the performance dropped suddenly one day - this got me wondering. I went to the terrace and found that the DC power supply line had gotten disconnected (some guest seems to have tripped on this line during a recent `pooja` event at home).

As you can see the performance of the "AA" fell drastically without power - pretty obvious (to many).

As soon as I connected the power back, the performance improved pretty dramatically and visibly!
