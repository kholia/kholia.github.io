I have designed, built and tested an all-HF WSPR beacon which produces 1W @ 5V and is rugged and cost-effective.

Power consumption: Around 420mA @ 5V.

Cost: Around 500 INR.

Time to build: Less than 30 minutes.

The files for this project are [published here](https://github.com/kholia/HF-PA-v10) for personal (non-commercial) usage.

For a 5W (QRO) WSPR beacon, please hold on for our upcoming QEX magazine article ;)

Special shoutout goes to Brad (K1TE) for always pushing me to do better - thank you!

Updated PCB design (more compact):

I am planning to use the following `Panel Mount USB Type C Female Connector Jack - JST-PH-2.0 Connector Output` in this project. Yes, the JST-PH connector on the PCB may need to be flipped around to ensure correct polarity.
