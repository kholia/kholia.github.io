Instead of punching islands or using commercial pads (islands) or making traditional pads myself, I simply make use of small pieces of single-sided PCBs to create the pads / islands easily for my boards.

## The Technique

This technique has a huge advantage over the `punched islands` or `scored and divided boards` techniques as it keeps the bottom ground plane perfectly 100% intact!

Also, it is almost a tool-free process to create the pads by breaking or cutting the single-sided PCBs. Single-sided prototyping boards also happen to be very reasonably priced.

## Variants

You can even use `Kapton / Koptan Tape` instead of these pieces of a single-sided PCB.
