Shipping hardware internationally is a hard, labor intensive, and overall a frustrating process - especially more so these days.

Here is our plan to supply the DDX to customers:

- Make the hardware files free / low-cost. The users will be able to order fully assembled boards from JLCPCB or other vendors on their own.

- Required a small licensing fee for the software firmware part. This is how we get to keep the hobby self-sustaining!

Future DDX architecture ideas (from Ismo and other folks):

Antenna ➔ CD2003 ➔ 455 kHz IF ➔ Ceramic filter SMD (HCI) ➔ "IF amplifier" needed? ➔ Pico 2's ADC ➔ Down-conversion and processing in digital domain ➔ Expose the processed audio samples over USB (Pico 2 acts as a sound card).

Benefits: This enables reception of SSB and CW signals!

Alternate easier and traditional radio architecture:

Antenna ➔ CD2003 ➔ 455 kHz IF ➔ Ceramic filter SMD (HCI) ➔ BFO mixer ("product detector") ➔ Direct Sound output ➔ Pico 2's ADC ➔ Pico exposes the audio samples over USB

Alternate ideas: One of the more promising and well-tested CD2003 designs is documented @ http://www.kh-gps.de/cd2003_rx.htm. This actually looks like the most promising option!

Immediate architecture (for DDX-Commercial series):

Antenna ➔ RX path ➔ SMD BPF (7 to 28) ➔ CD2003 with AGC ON ➔ Small "emergency" 10k SMD pot to tweak volume one time ➔ (X)MCP6022 (fixed gain, MFB with LPF action) ➔ RP2350 2's ADC

In other news, I got a `DX 100` award with DDX on 10m recently - w00t!

  This way we can continue using `RP2350` instead of moving to something like `STM32H5` immediately
