I am a software security researcher and engineer with a deep interest in how
real systems fail at the boundaries between software, firmware, hardware, and
RF.

My primary background is in software and platform security, with hands-on
exploration of embedded systems, wireless protocols, RF hardware, and FPGAs
driven by professional curiosity. This site documents practical experiments,
research notes, and prototypes that examine security assumptions in real-world
systems - beyond theory and specifications.

The work here focuses on:

- Software and embedded security

- Hardware and RF attack surfaces

- Security trust boundaries

- Practical validation of security models using real hardware

These are independent research notes and learning experiments, shared to
encourage deeper understanding of system security from the physical layer
upward.

Security does not stop at code - it extends into silicon, signals, and the
physical world.
